# Summary 

## Task 1
This R code defines a function to compute the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer, generate Collatz sequences for a range of starting values, and store the results in a tibble for further analysis or visualisation.

## Task 2
This R code analyses the Collatz sequences generated in the previous section and provides answers to three questions related to the sequences: finding the top 10 starting integers with the longest sequences, identifying the starting integer with the highest maximum value in its sequence, and comparing the average length as well as standard deviation of sequences for even and odd starting integers. The results are saved as RDS files for further use.

## Task 3
This R code analyses Collatz sequences to answer several questions related to backtracking behaviour, the number of times the sequences go above their initial values, the maximum value reached after the first backtrack, and whether backtracking sequences are more common among even or odd initial integers. The results are stored and printed for further analysis.
